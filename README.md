Arduino ONE + EL Escudo shield for EL WIRE brain presented at DEFCON 30

//*You can find the code for a test arduino UNO hooked up to a microphone sensor, which controls 3 EL Wires

//* You can also find one of the brain panels code, which controls output based on temperature, humidity and distance.

Have fun.
